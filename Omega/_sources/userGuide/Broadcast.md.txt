## Broadcast

In any parallel code, there is sometimes a need to broadcast values from
one processor to all other processors. This is implemented in Omega as a
Broadcast. Functions are available to broadcast scalars or vectors of any
supported data type. There are no user-configurable options for this
functionality. More details can be found in the
[Developer Guide](#omega-dev-broadcast).
